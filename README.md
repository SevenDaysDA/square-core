    <p>Flexible and Extensible Question Answering Platform</p>
</h3>

<!-- Introduction of SQuARE -->
SQuARE is a flexible and extensible Question Answering (QA) platform to enable users to easily implement, manage and share their custom QA pipelines (aka Skills in SQuARE).

Two ways are supported to use SQuARE:
1. üåê Get access to the existing QA Skills (and even deploy your Skill!) via our [demo page](https://square.ukp-lab.de/);
2. üíæ Or clone and install SQuARE to host services on a local machine.

## Why SQuARE?

Recent advances in NLP and information retrieval have given rise to a diverse set of question answering tasks that are of different formats (e.g., extractive, abstractive), require different model architectures (e.g., generative, discriminative) and setups (e.g., with or without retrieval). Despite having a large number of powerful, specialized QA pipelines (a.k.a., Skills) that consider a single domain, model or setup, there exists no framework where users can easily explore and compare such pipelines and can extend them according to their needs. 

To address this issue, we present SQuARE, an extensible online QA platform for researchers which allows users to query and analyze a large collection of modern Skills via a user-friendly web interface and integrated behavioural tests. In addition, QA researchers can develop, manage and share their custom Skills using our microservices that support a wide range of models (Transformers, Adapters, ONNX), datastores and retrieval techniques (e.g., sparse and dense).

Find out more about the project on [UKPs Website](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_ukp/ukp_research_projects/ukp_project_square/ukp_project_square_details.en.jsp).  

## Get Started
üëâ If you want to use the SQuARE public service online, you can refer to [Online Service](#Online-Service) for using the existing skills and refer to 
[Add New Skills](#Add-New-Skills) for adding new skills.

üëâ If you want to deploy SQuARE locally yourself, please refer to [Local Installation](#Local-Installation).

üëâ For illustration of the architecture, please refer to [Architecture](#Architecture).

üëâ And welcome to [contact us](#Contact).

## Online Service
Try out the on-the-go skills on the [demo page](https://square.ukp-lab.de/)! The existing skills include span-extraction, abstractive, multi-choice QA with contexts or without contexts (open QA based on retrieval).

## Add New Skills
Currently we support four QA formats: `span-extraction`, `abstractive`, `multiple-choice`, `categorical`.
If your Skill is compatible with any of these formats, you can easily deploy your skill with a API call. Let's deploy a Skill that uses an Adapter for RoBERTa-base to solve HotpotQA. You would need the following fields in the POST API call:
- `name`: the name of your Skill.
- `url`: possible values:
    -  `http://extractive-qa"` if you want span extraction.
    -  `http://multiple-choice-qa` if you want multiple-choice.
    -  `http://generative-qa` if you want a generative skill.
- `skill-type`: possible values:
    -  `abstractive`
    -  `span-extraction`
    -  `multiple-choice`
    -  `categorical`
- `skill_settings` is a dictionary with the keys `requires_context` (true/false) and `requires_multiple_choices` (0,1,2,...)
- `default_skill_args` is the **most important value**. It is a dictionary with the keys: `base_model` (eg: `roberta-base`) and `adapter` (eg: `AdapterHub/roberta-base-pf-hotpotqa`)
-  `user_id` is your user name
-  `published` true if you want the Skill to be publicly available.
-  `skill_input_examples` is a list of QA examples.

Then, the API call to deploy HotpotQA RoBERTa-base Adapter would be:
```
{
  "name": "HotpotQA RoBERTa-base Adapter",
  "url": "http://extractive-qa",
  "description": "Extractive QA",
  "skill_type": "span-extraction",
  "skill_settings": {
    "requires_context": true,
    "requires_multiple_choices": 0
  },
  "default_skill_args": {
      "base_model": "roberta-base",
      "adapter": "AdapterHub/roberta-base-pf-hotpotqa"
  },
  "user_id": "general",
  "published": true,
  "skill_input_examples": [
    {
      "query": "What arms did Moonwatchers band carry?",
      "context": "At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They carry their bone clubs and bone knives. Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their hearts."
    }
  ]
}

```

### Step 1: Hosting New Skills
- If you want to add new skills to the [public service](https://square.ukp-lab.de/), please follow the skill-package examples (e.g. [skills/qa-retrieve-span-skill](skills/qa-retrieve-span-skill)) and submit yours via a [pull request](https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-core/pulls). We will make it run after code review;
- It is also OK to host the skill yourself somewhere else. The only thing that matters here is to provide a URL and also match the argument formats.

### Step 2: Register the Skill
Go to your user profile and click on "My Skills" and "New" buttons. Fill out the form and link it to the hosted skills:

    <p>
</details>

## Local Installation
### Setup
Install [ytt](https://carvel.dev/ytt/docs/latest/install/)
```bash
brew instal ytt
```
### Environment Configuration
First, let's initialize the .env files from our examples. Run the following lines:  
```bash
mv skill-manager/.env.example skill-manager/.env 
mv datastore-api/.env.example datastore-api/.env 
mv skills/.env.example skills/.env 
mv keycloak/.env.example keycloak/.env 
mv postgres/.env.example postgres/.env 
cp square-frontend/.env.production square-frontend/.env.production-backup
cp square-frontend/.env.development square-frontend/.env.production
```
#### Update .env files
- For the _Skill-Manager_ (`./skill-manager/.env`) you can update the `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` for production purposes.
- In the _Datastore-API_ env file (`./datastore-api/.env`)  enter an `API_KEY`. This will secure the API, and only requests containing this key will be allowed.
- Copy the API key from the datastores to the _Skills_ env file (`./skills/.env`)
- For postgres and keycloak, set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DB_PASSWORD` to the same value. Also update the `KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD`

### Generate the docker-compose file
The docker-compose file is generated using the [ytt](https://carvel.dev/ytt/) templating tool. First, we need to update the [config.yaml](config.yaml) to the target platform.
- Set _environment_ to `local`
- Set _os_ to your operating system, e.g. `linux`, `mac` or `windows`
Now we can generate the docker-compose.yaml file by running:
```bash
ytt -f docker-compose.ytt.yaml -f config.yaml >> docker-compose.yaml  
```
### Get docker images
We now can pull the existing docker images from docker hub by running:
```bash
docker-compose pull
```
In order to inject the updated environment variables in the frontend, we need to rebuild it:
```bash
docker-compose build frontend
```
### Run 
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Check with `docker-compose logs -f` if all systems have started successfully. Once they are up and running go to https://square.ukp-lab.localhost.

üëâ enable the flag [chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost](chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost) in Chrome.
### Add Skills
Add Skills according to the [Add New Skills](#Add-New-Skills) section. Note that, for open-domain skills the datastore need to created first.

## Architecture
For a whole (open QA) skill pipeline, it requires 6 steps:
1. First a user selects a Skill and issues a query via the user interface;
2. The selected QA Skill forwards the query to the respective Datastore for document retrieval;
3. The Datastore gets the query embedding from the Models, uses it for semantic document retrieval and returns the top documents to the Skill;
4. The Skill sends the query and retrieved documents to the reader model for answer extraction;
5. Finally, the answers are shown to the user;
6. Optionally, the user can view the results of the predefined behavioural tests for the Skill.
